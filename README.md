**Objective:**  
Create a simple calculator using Python's Tkinter library that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features:**
- GUI-based with buttons for digits, operators, and functions (`C` for clear, `=` for result).
- Dynamically evaluates expressions and displays results or errors.
- User-friendly interface with grid layout for buttons.

**Technology:**  
- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI)

**How It Works:**  
Users input expressions via buttons, and the calculator evaluates and displays results. Errors are handled gracefully.

**Future Enhancements:**  
- Add advanced operations like square root or percentage.
- Improve design with custom themes and keyboard support.
